	<p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
	<ol>
		<li
		<li> We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</li>
		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it’s total run time</li>
		<li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</li>
